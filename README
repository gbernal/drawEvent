assignemnt for MAS.500 using OpenFrameworks for iOS 

This is a tiny iOS example for OpenFrameworks. I made two fixes to get this to build in Xcode 6 on Mavericks.

Installation

Get Xcode from the App Store - it should be version 6.1
Download and unzip OpenFrameworks v0.9.8 for iOS ( direct link )
Git clone this code and put it in the of_v0.9.8_ios_release/examples/ios/ directory
Building
